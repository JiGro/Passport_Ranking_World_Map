This code is designed to extract visa-related information for various countries from "visaindex.com" and visualize it on a world map using Folium library. It retrieves data for each country, including the country's rank, visa-free travel destinations, visa requirements, visa on arrival, electronic travel authorization (eTA), and countries offering visa applications online. The extracted information is then displayed on separate maps for each country, saved as HTML files.
